# 2D run-and-gun game
## Introduction
This is a 2D run-and-gun game developed in the Unity Engine. At the start of the game, the player
can customize their character attributes, which will change the character's statistics in the game.
Throughout the game, the player can interact with objects on the map where they can find arrows
and gold. In some cases, the player can even hide from enemies. Gold can be spent at the shop to
buy ammunition, bandages or upgrade weapons. The goal of the game is to survive as many days as
possible without dying.

## Character Attributes
- **Strenght:** By increasing your strength, your item carrying capability will increase as well as your shot power
- **Health:** By increasing your health statistic, your maximum health and maximum stamina will increase as well as your stamina regeneration.
- **Speed:** By increasing your stamina statistic, your stamina will be higher and your movement and sprinting speed will increase as well.
- **Intelligence:** By increasing your intelligence, your loot time will decrease while your loot boost will increase. Also, you will heal more HP whenever you bandage yourself.

## Interactable Objects
In the game, there are three types of interactable objects. The first one is a bush where the
player can hide from enemies. The second one is a trashcan where the player can find loot
however, some trashcans may be locked, requiring the player to pick the lock using their
secondary weapon. The third interactable object is a house where the player can hide and find
loot as well, but like the trashcan, it can also be locked.

## Inventory System
The player's inventory size depends on the player's strength statistic. In the inventory, the
player can carry arrows, bandages, and gold. Gold can be found in lootable objects on the
map, bandages can be bought at the shop, and arrows can be found in lootable objects or
bought at the shop. Each arrow has a break chance attribute, which can be lowered through
weapon upgrades. If an arrow does not break after hitting an object, the player can pick it up.
